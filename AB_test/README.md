# A/B Test Analysis of Recommender System

This project analyzes the results of an A/B test comparing a new product recommender system against the current version. The goal is to evaluate the impact on key user actions and determine whether the new system improves user behavior.

## Key Objectives

- Clean and preprocess test and event data  
- Validate test setup against technical specifications  
- Explore user activity and traffic distribution  
- Build and visualize conversion funnels  
- Assess statistical significance of key metric differences  
- Draw conclusions and formulate recommendations

## Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Plotly, Scipy, Statsmodels)
- Jupyter Notebook
- A/B test evaluation and funnel analysis
- Statistical hypothesis testing (z-test for proportions)

## Context

This project was developed as part of the **Yandex Practicum Data Analyst course**.
